<p>
A formula may contain brackets to &quot;weight&quot; specific parts of a compound relative to the other parts.  For example</p>
<p>
[.2Na]Cl would have a weight of</p>
<p>
 0.2*22.989768+35.4527=40.0507</p>
<p>
and NaCl-[.5H<sub>2</sub>O] would have a weight of:</p>
<p>
 22.989768+35.4527+0.5*(2*1.00794+15.9994)=67.4501</p>
<p>
A colleague of mine requested this feature for the purpose of trying to figure out if a compound he had synthesized and sent off for elemental analysis had a little bit of water in it (hadn't been completely dried), as in C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>-[.1H<sub>2</sub>O], to see if the theoretical percent composition data would better match the actual lab results.  </p>
<p>
NOTE: The <a href="PctSolverMode.htm">percent solver</a> feature will perform this operation for you.</p>
<p>
In earlier versions, decimal numbers could only be used after brackets and not after closing <a href="Parentheses.htm">parentheses</a> or after a <a href="Dashes.htm">dash</a>, however this restriction has now been removed.  Therefore, the above example could have also been entered as (Na)<sub>.2</sub>Cl or Na<sub>.2</sub>Cl or even Cl-.2Na</p>
<p>
If you would like brackets, [ and ], to be treated like regular parentheses, you can change this option in the <a href="ProgramOptions.htm">Program Preferences Window</a>.  However, when brackets are being treated as parentheses, all <a href="PctSolverMode.htm">percent solver</a> features will be disabled.</p>
