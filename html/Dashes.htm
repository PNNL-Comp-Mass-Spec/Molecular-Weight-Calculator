Dashes are used to add hydrates to a compound.  For example, FeCl<sub>3</sub>-6H<sub>2</sub>O means ferric chloride with 6 water molecules attached.  As shown, an integer can follow the dash, though it's not required (in which case 1 is assumed to follow the dash).  In fact, the dash can be used many times to add multiple hydrates onto a compound (if you have the desire).  Also, other molecules besides hydrates can be added.  For example (fictional compound) C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O-2ZnHgMg-U would be benzene + water + 2*(zinc+mercury+magnesium) + uranium for a total molecular weight of 914.73.  Decimal numbers can also be entered after a dash to add fractional parts of hydrates or other compounds, for example FeCl<sub>3</sub>-2.5H2O</p>
