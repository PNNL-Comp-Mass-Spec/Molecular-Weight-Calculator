<p>The program now includes support for international languages.  Language information files for Spanish, German, Portuguese, and Russian are included with the program.  To switch to a new language, select Choose Language from the Options Menu and choose the new language.  In addition, the program examines your International Locale settings to determine if your decimal point is a period or a comma.</p>

<p>All text phrases in the program, including menus, labels, dropdown boxes, and messages can be translated into any Roman or Cyrillic based language by creating a new Lang.Ini file for your desired language.  First, copy the Lang_English.Ini 
file to a new file and name it based on your language.  For example, the Spanish version is Lang_Spanish.ini</p>

<p>Each text phrase or control caption is identified by a unique number.  You can edit your new .Ini file to translate all of the English phrases to your desired language.  Note that the program examines all of the Lang*.ini files in the program directory to create the list of available languages, obtaining the name of the language from the key Language=  &nbsp;&nbsp; See the text at the start of the Lang_English.ini file for additional instructions
</p>

<p>If you do create a Lang.Ini file for a language not included with the distribution of this program, please e-mail it to me so that I may distribute it with the next version.  Even if you only translate some of the phrases (with the menus being most important) I would definitely appreciate receiving a copy of the file.
