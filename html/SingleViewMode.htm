You can see the percent composition of the compounds by pressing the F8 key.  Although only one formula is shown at a time, the other formulas are kept in memory and can be cycled through using the UP and DOWN keys without switching back to <a href="MultiViewMode.htm">Multi View</a> Mode.  In Single View Mode the formulas can still be completely modified.  The ENTER key or Calculate Button will calculate a formula's molecular weight and percent composition.  However, in Single View Mode, pressing the ENTER key or clicking the Calculate Button will keep the same formula visible; only the UP and DOWN arrow keys will move to a new formula in Single View Mode.  Use the <a href="NewFormula.htm">new formula button</a> to create a new formula.</p>
