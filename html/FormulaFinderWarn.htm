<p>
When loading the <a href="FormulaFinder.htm">Formula Finder</a> or <a href="PeptideFragModelling.htm">Peptide Sequence Fragmentation Modelling</a> module while using Average Atomic Weights, the weight mode warning screen will appear to warn the user that these tools are most often used when a precise mass of a compound is determined via mass spectrometry.  This is usually performed using <a href="EditingElements.htm">Isotopic Weights</a>, so the program warns of this and gives the user the option to switch to isotopic weights this time only, always switch to isotopic weights, or continue using <a href="EditingElements.htm">Average Weights</a>.  A checkbox is also present in case the user wants to stop the warning dialog from appearing again.  If the checkbox is selected, whatever option is currently selected will become the default option.</p>

<p>
The weight mode warning screen behavior can be explicitly set on the <a href="ProgramOptions.htm">Program Preferences Window</a>.
