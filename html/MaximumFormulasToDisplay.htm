<h2><a name="maximum_formulas"></a><img src="../images/MwtWinIcon.gif" border=0> Maximum Number of Formulas To Display</h2>
<p>Location: <a href="ProgramOptions.htm">Program Preferences Window</a></p>

<p>The maximum number of formulas that can be displayed at a given time is determined by your current screen resolution.  You may set the maximum to a lower number to prevent the main program window from filling the screen.  Recall that a new formula is added when the Enter key is pressed in the bottom-most formula, or when the <a href="NewFormula.htm">New Formula</a> button is clicked.</p>

<p>The program keeps track of the screen resolution used when the program was previously run.  If the detected resolution is different than that used previously, the maximum number of formulas to display will be set to the maximum allowable for the new resolution minus 2, unless in 640x480 mode where it will be set to 7.</p>

<p>The values for various common resolutions are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>640x480 = 7
	<li>800x600 = 9
	<li>1024x768 = 12
	<li>1152x864 = 14
	<li>1280x960 = 16
	<li>1280x1024 = 18
	<li>1600x1200 = 21
</ul>
