<p>If the Molecular Weight Calculator is running and you accidentally (or intentionally) try to run it again, a warning dialog will appear warning you that another copy (instance) is already running.  Choose yes to start another copy, or no to cancel.</p>

<p>
If you do have multiple copies running, and <a href="autosaveOptionsEtc.htm">AutoSave Options</a> is enabled, then each instance will write its formulas, options, and values to disk when exited.  If each of the instances points to the same executable file (MwtWin.exe), then the values for the instance closed last will overwrite any values saved by the previous instances.</p>
