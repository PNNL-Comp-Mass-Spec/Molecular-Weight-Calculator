About the Author</dt>
<dd>
<p>
I am a graduate of the University of North Carolina chemistry program, specializing in proteomics and bioinformatics while working with Dr. James Jorgenson. My areas of expertise include analytical instrumentation design and automation, microcolumn liquid chromatography, and mass spectrometry, in addition to software design using both Visual Basic and LabView. I am currently working with Dr. Richard D. Smith at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, WA. I have been programming since 1986 when I learned BASIC on an Apple //c (with 128 KB of Ram and no hard disk). Since then, I have updated to GW-Basic, then QuickBasic v4.5 and QuickBasic v7.1 for DOS, Visual Basic 3.0 for Windows, Visual Basic 5.0 for Windows 95, and now Visual Basic 6.0. I have experience with C and C++ programming but predominantly use VB due to the ease and simplicity with which software can be written.
