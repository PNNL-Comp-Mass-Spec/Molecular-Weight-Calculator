MwtWin.Dll Change Log

Version 2.37, Build 77; August 5, 2011
	- Recompiled due to new computer OS

Version 2.37, Build 76; October 18, 2010
	- Recompiled due to new computer OS

Version 2.37, Build 75; October 10, 2010
	- Now checking for PredictedConvIterations in ComputeIsotopicAbundancesInternal surpassing the 32-bit integer boundary (2147483647)
	- Now checking for the Iteration tracking variable in ConvoluteMasses surpassing the 32-bit integer boundary
		- If this happens, then resets the iterations to 0

Version 2.37, Build 74; October 16, 2009
	- Added support for c and z ions in function GetFragmentationMasses()
	- Changed blnShowCharge() from type Integer to type Boolean in the GetFragmentationMasses() function

Version 2.36, Build 70; February 23, 2007
	 - Added option to include 3+ fragmentation ions in the GetFragmentationMasses() function

Version 2.36, Build 67; November 5, 2006
	- Updated ComputeIsotopicAbundancesInternal to properly interpret Charge state
		- If intChargeState=0, then returns neutral masses
		- If intChargeState=1, then returns M+H masses
		- If intChargeState>1, then returns convoluted m/z masses
	- Updated ConvoluteMassInternal to convert from neutral mass to M+H and to return 0 if the current charge or desired charge is 0
