Thank you for inquiring about how to include your software
program in SimTel, the Coast to Coast Software Repository (tm).

As you may know, the Repository is maintained by Coast to Coast
Telecommunications, Inc. (CCT) on its host computer on the Internet
located at "SimTel.Coast.NET" which is not accessible without our
express permission.

Our Repository exists to help software authors gain a wider audience for
their programs than they can individually give them.  Thus we allow many
so called "mirror sites", currently about 65, on the worldwide Internet,
to copy our host Repository (at irregular intervals of their choosing),
as long as the mirror sites are accessible FREE OF CHARGE to Internet
users for browsing and downloading any program.  We insure this free
access by asserting our compilation copyright on the Repository, and
on report of abuse by a mirror site, denying access to our host.

One mirror site is FTP.Coast.NET.  Please read our copyright notice on
that host.  We understand that the author maintains his or her authorship
copyright which is how the author may expect to gain compensation from
the actual end user of the program(s) and that the author can also
control all other aspects of distribution of these works not related
to us.

To support our efforts, we offer (800) access to the host Repository and
make CD-ROM disks of the entire Repository for sale.  If we accept your
program, it most likely will be included in future editions of OUR
CD-ROMs.  To enlarge exposure of programs to the potential universe
of end users, we occasionally license other CD-ROM vendors to offer
abridged and unabridged versions of the Repository on CD-ROMs made by
them.  Our licenses have the option whether or not to include your
program(s) on their offerings.

Please do NOT upload your program(s) if you object to such activities
without compensation from CCT and its licensees.  By uploading your
program(s) you agree to look to the individual end user(s) for your
sole source of compensation for the use of your work, and *not* CCT,
its distributors, licensees or their distributors, or any Internet
mirror sites.

You also understand and agree that we can not call your program back
from such distribution.  If we accept a program, we try to update our
host as soon as possible, and once it appears there we will not stop
further distribution... so please if you have any concern about our
distribution system, do NOT upload, because once you do, it's too late.

NOTE: By the act of uploading you affirm that you are the author or the
author's authorized agent and that the author has read and agreed with
the terms of our compilation copyright and distribution policies.

[Note: This is private information.  Do not forward or quote from it.]

The upload account used for submissions of files to the SimTel
Software Repository is:

     Site: SimTel.Coast.NET (205.149.128.6)  (this is *not* ftp.coast.net)
 Username: incoming
 Password: bqvsp2xr

This account and password information is for your eyes only.

ZIP v2.x is the preferred format for uploads.  ZIP v1.10 files are also
accepted but will be repacked in ZIP v2.x format.  We cannot handle other
archive formats at this time.

SimTel policy does not allow self-extracting files (except for archivers,
where a chicken-and-the-egg situation exists) because a few downloaders
have destroyed their file systems by improperly transferring binary files
in text mode.  This problem does not exist on BBSs, but it's a very real
one for Internet users.  If the program you are submitting is an archiver
it must be uploaded inside a ZIP file for error checking purposes.

You can convert a self-extracting archive file to its native format with
Vernon Buerg's "FV" program.

SimTel/msdos/arcutil/
fv145.zip       View dirs of ARC/DWC/LBR/LZH/PAK/ZIP/ZOO/SFXs

It preserves any -AVs the ZIP may have because it simply trims the SFX
executable off the front of the input file and makes a new file.

Please try to limit the size of each file to 700K or less so that
downloaders can put them on a diskette.  This is a guideline, not a
requirement.  Experience has shown that larger files get less downloads
due to downloader's disk space or modem time limitations.

Please do not upload a large number of files at one time.  SimTel
receives about 360 uploads per month.  If one person uploads a large
number of files at one time they are usually put aside so they will not
disrupt processing of other uploads.  It may take as long as two months
to get around to screening and cataloging them.

Please remember to use the "binary" or "tenex" mode when uploading binary
files with FTP.  Please check the filesize in SimTel's incoming directory
with the dir command after uploading to make sure that it's the same as
the original file.

SimTel policy does not allow replacing an existing file by another with
the same name because we cannot guarantee that every mirror site or ANY
of the TRICKLE sites will replace the old file with the new file.  Most
mirror sites will get it because it has a different datestamp and size,
but most TRICKLE sites will NOT re-fetch files they have already gotten
in response to user requests.

Please choose a name with the version number in it in order to help
users spot updates.

Please note: Files or programs submitted without upload announcements
will not be accepted.  To assure authenticity, SimTel requires that
upload announcements (in English) be sent to me by e-mail and the real
name of the uploader must be included in the announcement.  Upload
announcements in the form of text files uploaded to the incoming
directory are deleted by script that removes all non-zip files from the
incoming directory before the uploaded files are moved to the reviewing
area.

Send your announcement to me by e-mail with a one line description
for each file you have uploaded.  A longer description of 10-20 lines
should also be included in the same message, which will be used for my
announcement of the file to the net.  Please include a suggestion of
the SimTel directory that would be the best place to put your file.

The one-line description should use the format shown in this sample
template. 

SimTel/msdos/io_util/
whtprt40.zip    Displays system serial ports & IRQ assignments
12345678.123____123456789.123456789.123456789.123456789.123456
^^^^^^^^^^^^    ^--46 characters maximum in the description--^
     ^          ^--description starts at column 17
     ^--filename all lower case, left-justified with no blanks

The longer description should begin at the left margin (column 1) and
not exceed 76 characters per line.

Experience has shown that potential downloaders of new files are "turned
off" by announcements which are worded more like press releases than
informative postings.  Please avoid the use of superlatives.  Here are
some guidelines to help you avoid the appearance of "hype" in your
announcement.

  - A good announcement informs.
  - A bad announcement persuades.

You can most easily tell persuasion from information by the modifiers.
Adjectives and adverbs that make judgments are almost always persuaders
("great") as are those that would appeal to the user based on irrelevant
criteria ("new").  Claims that are not backed up by easily available
facts, including subjective claims ("best", "greatest"), are persuaders,
not information.  A claim of benefit to the user, other than those
implied by the product itself, is likely a persuader.

One example: "This will do your taxes", in the description of a tax
preparation program, is a claim of benefit to the user, implied by the
program; that's information.  "This will do your taxes better than any
other program" is not.  It has a judgment ("better") modifier, which is
a big clue.

Please make the description tell the purpose/use of the file, not things
like "Newest version of WOW.ZIP" or "Newest version of Chuck Forsberg's
DSZ".  In either of those examples I am left to answer questions from the
users about what the program does.

If there are special requirements such as EGA/VGA/SVGA, 286/386/486,
Pentium, EMS/XMS, etc., please include that information.

If you are the author of the program please include that information
in the announcement.  A simple "Uploaded by the author." is sufficient.

If you wish to include optional Usenet "Newsgroups:" and "Followup-To:"
information either in the header or as the first two lines of the
upload announcement that is mailed to me, they will be used for the
posting but inappropriate newsgroup(s) will be deleted.  If you don't
know what this information means, do not include these lines.

If the program is for Windows and you wish to have your announcement
posted to comp.os.ms-windows.announce you will have to do that yourself
by sending it by e-mail to  comp-os-ms-windows-announce@mail.uu.net
because the moderator of that newsgroup will not allow SimTel to post
your announcement to his newsgroup.

Each file should be announced in a separate message unless it is related
to one or more of the other files, such as a multi-part package.  The
message should be in the format described above.

Here is a sample upload announcement.  Each line has been offset by "> "
for this example to make it clear where the example begins and ends.  Do
not include the "> " in your announcement.  Begin your announcement with
the line "I have uploaded:" as shown below.  Do not include the header,
which is shown here only for clarity.

All uploads must run on or be related to MS-DOS, MS-Windows or Windows
95.  If your program uses Visual Basic's VBRUNxxx.DLL it is recommended
that it not be included because it is already available from the SimTel
collection as vbrun100.zip, vbrun200.zip, or vbrun300.zip.

Windows-NT uploads should be coordinated with winnt@SimTel.Coast.NET.
OS2 uploads should be coordinated with os2@SimTel.Coast.NET.  Please do
not upload NT or OS2 programs to the incoming directory listed above.

All files or programs must include documentation in the English language
(other languages are allowed but English must also be included).  There
must be a file included in the uploaded zip file that the user can read,
without running a program, which tells:

  1. What the program does, and how to use it.
  2. The program's status (Public Domain, FreeWare, ShareWare).
  3. The program's distribution status (it must be freely distributable).
  4. How to contact the author in case of questions or problems (mailing
     address, phone number and/or e-mail address).

If the user has to run a program to get this information there is a
chicken-and-the-egg problem if that program does not run because of an
incompatibility or a corrupted download.

Programs that stop working after a fixed date will not be accepted.

Because SimTel's collections are available all over the world, SimTel
cannot accept programs that are or might be subject to U.S. technology
export restrictions.  Encryption and decryption programs will not be
accepted, no matter what method is used.

Programs that crack copy protection or passwords will not be accepted.

Games are not accepted unless they are strictly educational.  There
are several sites on the Internet which specialize in other types of
games.

Thanks!
