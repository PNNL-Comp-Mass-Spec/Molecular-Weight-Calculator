' Comments may be added by preceding with an apostrophe
' Two group headings must exist: [AMINO ACIDS] and [ABBREVIATIONS]
' Abbreviations may be added; simply type the abbreviation and molecular
'   formula under the appropriate column in either section
' Note:  Only the first letter of an abbreviation is allowed to be capitalized
' Note:  Elements MUST be properly capitalized; eg. na is incorrect, use Na
' Note:  Parentheses and dashes are NOT allowed; eg. CH3(CH2)2 is incorrect
'                                                    use C3H7 or CH3CH2CH2
' The abbreviations in the Amino Acid section are treated as extended level
'   abbreviations:  they are only recognized when extended abbreviations are on
' If this file becomes corrupted, the MWT program will inform the user and
    ignore incorrect lines
' If this file becomes deleted, the MWT program will create a new file with
    the default abbreviations, but without the abbreviation descriptions

' Default Amino Acids are in their ionic form
' Amino Acid abbreviations may be up to 6 characters long
' It is strongly advised that longer abbreviations be placed first
