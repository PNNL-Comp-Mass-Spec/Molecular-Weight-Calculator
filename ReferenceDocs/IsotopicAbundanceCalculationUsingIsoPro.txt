	I wrote an isotope simulator in VB using Yergey's algorithm
(IJMSIP, 52, 1983, 337-49) a couple of years back.  It does all the
elements (isotope ratios can be modified) and has graphical output to the
screen and printer. Since it's written in VB, it's not real fast (ie. a
10 kDa protein takes 15 seconds to calculate the distribution and 20 to
display on a 486/33), but I'm working on a new version in Delphi that
should be 20x faster.  If you want a copy of the old version, send me a
note.  I make no claims to the accuracy of the algorithm (you get what
you pay for :), but Yergey was nice enough to give me his VAX Fortran
code to translate, so it should be safe.  All I know is that it matches
experimental distributions from ESI-FTMS instruments real well.
	Note:  I've not used the WWW distribution calculator myself,
but I've heard it's results are a little off.
